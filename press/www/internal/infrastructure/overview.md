# Local Infrastructure

Local infrastructure subsystem is a faster, cheaper and more flexible alternative to running virtual machines on a public cloud for development.

> Note: Local Insfrastructure is available for Linux hosts only. You're free to add Mac OS support by using Virtualbox.

## Prerequisites

#### Dependencies

- Packer - For building virtual machine images.
- Vagrant - Simplified CLI/API for managing virtual hosts.

  - vagrant-libvirt - For using KVM/Libvirt. Duh!
  - vagrant-hostmanager - For managing hosts file in guests and host machine.

- Libvirt/KVM - Virtualization provider.

### Installation

Dependencies can be installed with

```bash
source env/bin/activate
python3 apps/press/backbone/setup.py
```

> Note: After this logout completely and login again to start with local infrastructure. Start a new shell session. if you're on a Non-GUI server.

### Building Base Images

To spawn virtual machines quickly, we'll create a ubuntu base image (as seen on DigitalOcean or other cloud providers). This image can later be used to spawn blank virtual machines in seconds.

This can be done with (`backbone` CLI is installed with `press` application)

```bash
source env/bin/activate
backbone hypervisor build
```

> Note: When running for the very first time this will download a ~500 MB ubuntu image.

See contents of `press/backbone/packer` directory for more details.

### Spawning Virtual Machines

There's no simple CLI for this at the moment.

1. Create a Vagrant directory

```bash
mkdir scratch
cd scratch
ln -s ../apps/press/backbone/vagrant/Vagrantfile Vagrantfile
```

2. Start local cluster with the following command and provide sudo password when asked

```
vagrant up --no-parallel --provider=libvirt
```

You can destroy the machines with

```
vagrant destroy -f
```

and spawn them again with `vagrant up` command.

Local machines have following names/ips by default

| Type            | Name      | Public IP  | Private IP |
| --------------- | --------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Proxy Server    | n1.fc.dev | 10.0.1.101 | 10.1.1.101 |
| Frappe Server   | f1.fc.dev | 10.0.2.101 | 10.1.2.101 |
| Database Server | m1.fc.dev | 10.0.3.101 | 10.1.3.101 |
| Database Server | m2.fc.dev | 10.0.3.102 | 10.1.3.102 |

### Accessing VMs

You can ssh into these machines using following commands

```bash
ssh root@n1.fc.dev
```

```bash
vagrant ssh n1
```
