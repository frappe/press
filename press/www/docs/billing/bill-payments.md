# Bill Payments

Frappe Cloud billing cycles are monthly.

Your account balance accrues over the course of the calendar month based on
usage of your sites. We apply GST taxes to Indian customers.

We automatically invoice and charge your account's default payment method on the
first day of every month for the previous month's usage.

## Current Month's Usage

You can check your running usage amount in the Dashboard.

Go to Settings > Billing. Here you will see the usage amount to date. This
amount is updated every day based on the number of Active sites you have.

We finalize invoices on **the last day of each month at 6 PM IST**. Sites created
after this point will be a part of next month's billing cycle.

## Managing Cards

You can add cards from the Payment Methods section in the Billing Tab.

Click on **Add Payment Method** and enter your billing address and card details.
It will automatically become the default payment method.
