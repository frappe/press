This is `press`, a Frappe custom app that runs Frappe Cloud. This app manages infrastructure, subscription, marketplace, SaaS and much more.

> press: "I have a brother, without which I cannot live, agent"

The other half of the Frappe Cloud infrastructure is [agent](https://github.com/frappe/agent). Which is a flask application that runs on every server in a typical cluster and carries out tasks on HTTP requests. Creating a new site, installing an app, updating a site, creating a bench and everything in between is just a request (`Agent Job`) away.

> Note that, this README is in a very early WIP state and only covers a tiny bit of FC. More to come!
