### Changed
- Introduced stricter app versioning requirements for all Frappe apps.
- All apps (Marketplace and private) must now:
  - Include a `pyproject.toml` file
  - Declare a bounded Frappe dependency under `[tool.bench.frappe-dependencies]`.
  - Support is only added for NPM based versioning, 

### Breaking Changes
- Apps without a `pyproject.toml` file will fail validation.
- Apps using unbounded Frappe version ranges (e.g. `^`, `~`, or single-sided constraints) are rejected.

### Note on version syntax

Frappe app version constraints are validated using **NPM-style semantic versioning** (`NpmSpec`), in favour of internal frappe applications such as CRM and helpdesk.

As a result:
- Version ranges must follow **NPM semver syntax**
- Python-style version specifiers (PEP 440), such as `~=`, are **not supported**
